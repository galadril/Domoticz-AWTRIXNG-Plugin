## 🚀 Usage
### Push Button Notifications
The description of the push buttons (`Send Notification` and `Send Custom App`) can be used in three ways:
1. **JSON:**
   - Example: `{ "text": "600 L", "icon": 9766 }`
   - Multi page example `[{ "text": "600 L", "icon": 9766 }, { "text": "364 W", "icon": 95 }]`
2. **Icon;Message:**
   - Format: `icon;message`
   - Example: `9766;Check the temperature!`
3. **Message:**
   - Example: `Hello, AWTRIX!`

Check this sample dzVents script to in sequence push device states with icons to the device
[Samples](https://github.com/galadril/Domoticz-AWTRIXNG-Plugin/blob/master/samples/dzvents-sample.txt)

Or this script to adjust the overlay based on the weather
[Samples](https://github.com/galadril/Domoticz-AWTRIXNG-Plugin/blob/master/samples/dzvents-weather-overlay-sample.txt)

If you like to use dzVents to set the description of the notification and custom app switches, you need to allow 127.0.0.* as trusted network under Settings/Security

### Example JSONs
**Simple Notification JSON:**

```json
{
  "text": "21 C",
  "icon": 9766
}
```

For more details on all JSON options:
[Custom Apps and Notifications](https://blueforcer.github.io/awtrix-ng/#/api?id=custom-apps-and-notifications)

If multiple dzVents scripts are used to send different Custom Apps to the AWTRIX NG
using the Send Custom App button, it is best to also include an "appname" key and an appropriate
value in the JSON data, as otherwise the Custom Apps of the other dzVents scripts will be overwritten.

### Dismiss Notification
Toggling the `Dismiss Notification` push button triggers the AWTRIX NG `/api/notify/dismiss` endpoint, instantly clearing the currently displayed notification from the matrix.

### Icons
To display icons on the AWTRIX NG device, you need to manually upload them. You can fetch icons from the [LaMetric Developer Site](https://developer.lametric.com/icons).

- **Default Domoticz icon:** 39762

You can find the icon pack under the `/icons` directory in the GitHub repository.

For more details on AWTRIX NG and how to upload/setup icons:
[AWTRIX Icons Setup](https://blueforcer.github.io/awtrix-ng/#/icons)

### Settings
The description of the push button (`Send settings`) should be set to a JSON object, using the keys and values as defined by the [AWTRIX NG API](https://blueforcer.github.io/awtrix-ng/#/api?id=change-settings).

#### Example JSONs for changing the global settings
| Example                                       | JSON                                              |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Disable battery, humidity and temperature     | `{ "BAT": false, "HUM": false, "TEMP": false }`   |
| Enable weekday display, and use a green color | `{ "WD": true, "WDCA": [0, 255, 0] }`             |
| Show every app for 10 seconds with 2 s change | `{ "ATIME": 10, "TSPEED": 2000 }`                 |
